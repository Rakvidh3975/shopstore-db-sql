# shopstore-db-sql
A complete SQL project for managing products, customers, and orders in a shopping store
**Shopping Store SQL Project**
This project demonstrates the creation and management of a relational database for a shopping store using SQL. It focuses on implementing one-to-many and many-to-many relationships across four main tables:
customers – stores customer details
orders – stores order information linked to customers
products – stores product details, including price
order_items – manages the many-to-many relationship between orders and products
The project showcases:
Creating relationships between tables using foreign keys
Querying data to display each customer’s orders and the products included in them
Handling a many-to-many relationship between orders and products via the order_items table
